## Dataset Description

TMCAD v2 contains **9,799 CAD models** spanning **10 standardized mechanical part categories**.  
All models are provided in **STEP (.stp)** format with standardized naming conventions.
It was collected as part of the BRT to support research in learning from CAD models.

## Download and Use

The dataset is publicly available at the following location:

### TMCAD v2
The TMCAD dataset v2 (a refined version released on 2025.11.02) can be downloaded from: https://pan.zju.edu.cn/share/218d10a88e8c18f5b96e94a7e0


**TMCAD v2**  is a **cleaned and verified collection of 3D CAD mechanical parts**, designed for research in 3D **shape classification**, **representation learning**, and **retrieval**, etc. The specific improvements in v2 are:
- Removed mistakenly collected samples  
- Corrected wrong or ambiguous class labels  
- Verified and repaired invalid geometries  
- Merged visually and functionally similar classes (`bolt` + `screw`)  
- Ensured clean hierarchical directory structure


### TMCAD v1
The TMCAD dataset v1 (2025.02.10) can be downloaded from: https://pan.zju.edu.cn/share/305e1697a37277e6a9ec60dded

## Applications

TMCAD v2 can be directly used for a wide range of 3D geometric learning tasks:

- **3D Classification** — Train networks like PointNet, DGCNN, Point Transformer  
- **Shape Retrieval** — Evaluate similarity-based methods on mechanical components  
- **Cross-modal Tasks** — Combine with textual or image data for multi-modal learning  
- ...
